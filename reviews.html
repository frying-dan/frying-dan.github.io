        <div id="Humbug" style="width: 350px;">
            <p>Arctic Monkeys' third album, "Humbug," shows the band's skilled songwriting and musicianship with
                unexpected musical turns and a darker tone. It reflects the band's established place in the UK pop
                firmament. The album's highlight, "Cornerstone," is beyond lovelorn with Alex Turner's swooning, dreamy
                vocals, while "Crying Lightning" is the loudest, most aggressive track.</p>

        <div id="AM" style="width: 350px;">
            <p>Arctic Monkeys' "AM" marks a departure from their earlier music, with sleeker, more self-lacerating
                lyrics and a blend of classic rock influences. Singer Alex Turner explores the limbo of sex and love,
                struggling to find meaning in a world of furtive flirts and bad decisions. Ultimately, the album
                reflects on the difficulty of finding genuine connection in a world consumed by personal branding.</p>

        <div id="Spring" style="width: 350px;">
            <p>Wallows has released their debut EP, Spring, after the success of their first single, Pleaser. The album
                features a mix of nostalgic and sarcastic 1980s Horror Film to heavy hitting Pictures of Girls, with a
                more relaxed tone overall. The EP's opening song, Ground, is a laid-back tune, while It's Only Right is
                a surf-rock inspired track with an interesting tempo switch. The highly anticipated 1980s Horror Film is
                Wallows' only true acoustic song.</p>

        <div id="Hozier" style="width: 350px;">
            <p>Hozier's debut self-titled album, "Hozier," showcases his powerful, soulful voice and thoughtful lyrics.
                The album's breakout hit, "Take Me to Church," is a passionate and emotional commentary on religion and
                sexuality. Other standout tracks include the hauntingly beautiful "From Eden," the gospel-influenced
                "Angel of Small Death and the Codeine Scene," and the upbeat "Jackie and Wilson."</p>
